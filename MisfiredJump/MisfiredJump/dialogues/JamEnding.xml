			<Page>Hey there!</Page>
			<Page>MisfiredJump is a mod made for the 4th OW modding jam under the themes 'Escape'/'Isolation' with the restriction of 'Minimal text'.</Page>
			<Page>So.. as it often goes, overscoping was a real issue during this jam.</Page>
			<Page>I cut out a lot of what I wanted to do, but even then I still didn't have time to finish this last puzzle.</Page>
			<Page>Not too big a deal, since the telescope was already a big one, but an ending like this is a bit abrupt (I do intend on finishing the mod post-jam mind you)</Page>
			<Page>Regardless, I hope you had fun with my mod as it stands right now.</Page>
			<Page>One last challenge I have for you if you haven't found him already, is to find our usual anglerfish Easter egg. Otherwise, just get closer to the probe to earn your gameover screen. Cheers!</Page>
