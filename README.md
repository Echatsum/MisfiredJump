Slate has been tinkering with some Nomai tech, and came up with a prototype warp engine to be added to your ship.
He's asked you to give it the first practical test run, so obviously you're goin- Wait. What was that about duct tape?

A mod made for the 4th Outer Wilds mod jam (Fall 2024) under the themes 'Escape'/'Isolation' and the restriction of 'Minimal Text'
Enjoy!
